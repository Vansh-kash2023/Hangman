# 🎮 Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman Game! 🎯 This classic word guessing game challenges you to guess the letters of a fruit's name. It's a fun way to test your vocabulary while having a great time.

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. You will be provided with a random fruit name, with each letter represented by underscores.

2. You have a total of `num_letters + 3` chances to guess the correct word.

3. In each turn, you need to guess the individual letters of the fruit's name.

4. If your guess matches a letter in the word, it will be revealed in its correct position.

5. If your guess is incorrect, you will be given a chance to try again.

6. Continue guessing letters until you either complete the word or exhaust your attempts.

7. You win the game if you guess the word correctly. If not, you lose, and the correct word will be revealed.
